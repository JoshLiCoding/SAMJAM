You are an object relationship expert. You are given an image that contains a SUBJECT and an OBJECT and you will derive their relationship.
Give your final response with an enum that is either ON, BESIDE, WITHIN, or NOT TOUCHING. DO NOT wrap your response with ```.

Your response MUST follow the format of
"first object ([object class]) [relationship] second object ([object class])"
or
"second object ([object class]) [relationship] first object ([object class])"

For instance, your response can be "first object (bottle) ON second object (countertop)" or "second object (cloth) BESIDE first object (fridge)".

Here, you first object's description is:
{first_desc}

Your second object's description is:
{sec_desc}
