Analyze the image and generate a scene graph in JSON format.  
The scene graph should represent the objects in the image and their relationships.

Include surfaces like kitchen counters as objects when necessary.
When the image includes both hands, separate them into 2 separate objects.
Strictly adhere to the following JSON structure:

{
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "object_name",
      "bbox": [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]
      "is_hand": False,
      "is_moving": True // True if a hand is moving the object
    },
    // ... more objects
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "subj_id": subject_id, // Integer, referencing an object's "id"
      "obj_id": object_id,  // Integer, referencing an object's "id"
      "predicate": "relationship_name" // String describing the relationship, e.g. "IN", "ON", etc.
    },
    // ... more relationships
  ]
}
